# Regular shapes in 3d fractograms

Period 6 - Hexagonal: 	[7, 13, 	39, 63, 77, 91,      143, 273,      429, 693, 819,      1001, 1287, 3003, 9009]
Period 3 - Triangular:	[       27, 37,                 111,           333,                999,                   ]


All the period 3 fractions shown above can be rewritten in the form n/999, where n is a factor of 999.
999 = 3<sup>3</sup> × 37

1/27  = 37/999 = 0.037037...
1/37  = 3<sup>3</sub>/999 = 0.027027...
1/111 = 3<sup>2</sub>/999 = 0.009009...
1/333 = 3<sup>1</sub>/999 = 0.003003...
1/999 = 3<sup>0</sub>/999 = 0.001001...

H. Duncan showed that all period 3 fractions form equilateral triangles.

All the period 6 fractions shown above can be rewritten in the form n/999999, where n is a factor of 999999.
999999 = 3<sup>3</sub> × 7 × 11 × 13 × 37

1/7     = 3<sup>3</sub> × 11 × 13 × 37 /999999
1/13    = 3<sup>3</sub> × 7 × 11 × 37  /999999
etc... <!-- why not all combinations of factors? e.g why not 1/21 = 047619/999999 -->
1/9009  = 3 × 37 /999999

<!-- Maybe 999999999 is worth investigating... -->
